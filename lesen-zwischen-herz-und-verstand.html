            <p>Lena remembered the moments when she had felt so connected, as if the words between them had built a bridge that could overcome all uncertainties. But now this bridge had disappeared, and she stood again on the shore, unsure how to cross the river. She opened the drawer of her desk and took out the stack of letters that she and Julian had written to each other. Each letter was a piece of their shared history, proof that they had once had a deep connection. She leafed through the pages, reading here and there a sentence that caught her eye. "I feel like we understand each other in a language that no one else speaks." "Your words are like a home to me." "Sometimes I wonder if we will ever really understand each other." These sentences echoed within her, and she felt a stab in her chest. Why was it so hard to transfer this connection to the real world? Why did it feel like they could breathe so much easier on paper than in real life?</p>

            <p>She put the letters back in the drawer and closed it. Maybe it was time to start something new, something that wasn't burdened by the past. She went to the kitchen and put water on for tea. While waiting for the water to boil, she thought about her future. She had always dreamed of becoming a writer, but now that she had the chance, it felt like something was missing. Maybe it was the certainty that someone was there who believed in her, who supported her. Julian had done that, in his letters, but in real life everything was more complicated. The kettle whistled, and she poured the hot water over the tea bag in her cup. The scent of chamomile rose to her nose and calmed her a little. She took the cup and went back to the living room, sat down on the sofa and looked out the window. The city now lay in darkness, only scattered lights still burned in the windows of the houses. It was a calming sight that gave her the feeling of not being completely alone.</p>

            <p>She sipped her tea and felt the warmth spreading within her. Maybe that was the key, she thought. Maybe she had to learn to be sufficient for herself, to trust herself, before she could try again to build a bridge to someone else. She closed her eyes and leaned back, letting the silence of the evening wash over her. It was a new beginning, a blank page, and maybe that was exactly what she needed. The possibility of writing something new, without the burden of the past. She breathed deeply and felt a spark of hope kindling within her. Maybe this was the moment when she could learn to breathe again, to live again, without clinging to someone else. She opened her eyes and looked at the blank sheets of paper on her desk. Maybe it was time to write her own story, a story that wasn't about Julian or Emil, but about herself. About Lena, who stood alone but was not lost. About Lena, who was ready to live her own life, with all its uncertainties and possibilities.</p>

            <p>She took a deep sip of her tea and felt a new determination growing within her. She would write, not for someone else, but for herself. She would find her own voice, tell her own story. And maybe, just maybe, she would learn to breathe again in the process, to live again, completely on her own. She stood up, went to her desk and sat down. The blank sheets lay before her, ready to be filled with words. She took the pen in her hand and felt something come alive within her. It was time to write her own story. She felt the tip of her pen touch the paper, and began to write, without hesitation, without thinking. The words flowed out of her as if they had been waiting for a long time to finally be free. It was as if a door inside her opened, a door that she had kept locked for a long time.</p>

            <p>She wrote about the silence that surrounded her, about the feeling of being alone, but not lonely. She wrote about the city that lay outside, about the lights that shone in the darkness, about the sounds that drifted up to her. She wrote about the letters that she and Julian had exchanged, about the connection they had found on paper, and about the difficulty of transferring this connection to the real world. She wrote about Emil, about the moments they had shared together, about the laughter, the tears, the hope and the disappointment. She wrote about the feeling she had when he left, about the emptiness he had left behind, and about the realization that this emptiness would not remain forever. She wrote about her dreams, her fears, her hopes and her uncertainties. She wrote about the people she knew, about the friendships she had made, and about the relationships she had lost.</p>

            <p>She wrote about her family, about the expectations they had placed on her, and about the expectations she placed on herself. She wrote about the moments when she had felt strong, and about the moments when she had felt weak. She wrote about the love she had felt, and about the love she had lost. She wrote about the hope she had, and about the hope she had lost. She wrote about the dreams she had, and about the dreams she had given up. She wrote about the moments when she had believed she knew everything, and about the moments when she had realized she knew nothing. She wrote about the decisions she had made, and about the decisions she regretted. She wrote about the paths she had taken, and about the paths she had not taken. She wrote about the doors she had opened, and about the doors she had closed. She wrote about the chances she had taken, and about the chances she had missed. She wrote about the moments when she had felt free, and about the moments when she had felt trapped.</p>
